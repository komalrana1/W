## Understanding Parts Work Therapy

Parts work therapy, also known as Internal Family Systems (IFS), recognizes that our personality is composed of different "parts" or subpersonalities. These parts can have varying roles, beliefs, and emotions. The goal of parts work therapy is to understand these parts, heal their wounds, and integrate them into a cohesive whole.

Why is this important? Unresolved trauma and negative experiences can cause these parts to become polarized, leading to inner conflict, anxiety, and depression. Parts work provides a framework for understanding and resolving these issues.
