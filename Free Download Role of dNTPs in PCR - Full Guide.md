## What are dNTPs and Why are They Important in PCR?

**dNTPs (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates)** are the building blocks of DNA. They are absolutely essential for **DNA synthesis during PCR**. Without dNTPs, the polymerase enzyme would have nothing to use to create new DNA strands, rendering the PCR process impossible.

*   **Building Blocks:** dNTPs provide the raw materials for extending DNA strands.
*   **Specificity:** The correct dNTP (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP) must be incorporated according to the template strand.
*   **Enzymatic Activity:** DNA polymerase uses dNTPs to catalyze the addition of nucleotides to the 3' end of a primer.
